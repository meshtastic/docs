|     Neighbor Info     |                                                                                              Send info on 0-hop neighbors to the mesh.                                                                                              |

|       Range Test      | Send messages with GPS location at an interval to test the distance your devices can communicate. Requires (at least) one device set up as a sender and one as a receiver. The receiver(s) will log all incoming messages to a CSV. |
|    Remote Hardware    |                                                                                          Set and read a GPIO status remotely over the mesh.                                                                                         |

|    Store & Forward    |                                                                         Stores messages on a device for delivery after disconnected clients rejoin the mesh.                                                                        |
|       Telemetry       |                                                                        Attach sensors to the device and transmit readings on a regular interval to the mesh.                                                                        |
